# The AAPS plugin

A `DataSyncSelector` sibling of `plugins/sync/xdrip`, kept in this repository
rather than in the AAPS tree.

## Why it lives here

The native symbol names are derived from `SwarmNative`'s package and class name,
so the Kotlin and the Rust are one contract. Renaming either half breaks the
other **at load time on a phone**, not at compile time on a desktop. One
repository makes that a single commit that fails loudly.

The same reasoning runs through the whole module: nothing with a decision in it
is written twice. The record shape, canonical encoding, rounding, deduplication
and epoch arithmetic are all in [`crates/diaswarm-core`](../crates/diaswarm-core),
which is asserted byte-identical to `tools/canon.py` over 19,129 real records.
Kotlin owns only what Rust cannot see: the typed `DataPair`s, the `isValid`
check, and this plugin's own high-water marks.

## Wiring it into an AAPS checkout

`settings.gradle`:

```groovy
include ':plugins:sync:swarm'
project(':plugins:sync:swarm').projectDir = new File('/path/to/diaswarm/plugin')
```

Then build with the NDK visible:

```sh
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=~/Android/Sdk/ndk/29.0.14206865
./gradlew :plugins:sync:swarm:assembleRelease
```

`buildRustCore` cross-compiles the core for `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a` and
copies the `.so` into `src/main/jniLibs`, where the library packages it from.
The `.so` is **not committed**: a checked-in binary is a second, opaque copy of
the frozen spec that nobody can diff and everybody trusts.

## What is not done

- **`publish()` does nothing.** The plugin canonicalises and counts; it has no
  swarm to publish to yet. Sealing is `tools/seal.py` (the reference) and
  `spike/p2panda-seal` (what the shipping key layer does), and neither is wired
  in. A plugin that pretended to publish would be worse than one that says it
  does not.
- **`ProfileSwitch` is not mapped.** §2 requires ISF and target blocks
  normalised to mg/dL, because AAPS stores profile blocks in whichever unit the
  user set while glucose values and temporary targets are always mg/dL.
  Emitting one un-normalised would put the same quantity in one stream a factor
  of eighteen apart. It needs the block API read properly first.
- **Nothing has run on a phone.** It compiles as a module and the native half
  links for both ABIs; that is not the same as working, and the difference is
  the kind this project has already been caught by.
